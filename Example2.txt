What is the difference between JTextField.setEnabled() and JTextField.setEditable()? In my code I have an Instance of a class inherited from JTextField. But when I set its property setEnabled(false) I can still edit and process its contents in my program. However when I set its property setEditable(false) I can no longer edit its text. If it is so. Then what is the purpose of setEnabled() property here?
